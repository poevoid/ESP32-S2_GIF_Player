# ESP32-S2_GIF_Player
Play gifs on an SH1106 display using the lolin S2 mini, a very cheap dev board. To use it you will have to successfully flash circuitpython 9.x to the device first, then just copy this repo to CIRCUITPY. GIFs must be black and white only, with 128x64px resolution. Can also tell time with a wifi connection.
